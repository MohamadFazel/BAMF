Here are two demos of RJMCMC:
   Circle is a synthetic dataset
   Actin  is an experimental dataset

The subdirectories contain results and data.
Unfortunately the data for actin was too large and could not be uploaded on github.
You can find this data in the supplementary software package of the paper published 
in Scientific Reports, 2019:
"Bayesian Multiple Emitter Fittign using Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo"
